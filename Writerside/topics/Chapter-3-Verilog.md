# Chapter 3: Verilog

Before we can assign our pins, we need to define our Verilog program. This means creating a .v file, writing the module,
and finally synthesizing the design. Now, I personally find the tab layout of Diamond to be a bit cumbersome, with
important menus hidden under each other. I like to split my tabs up and stack them to the left. This is done by "pulling"
on the top of the menu tab, then sliding it into position.

Let's explain our view for a little bit:
- File list:
    Pretty self-explanatory, offers a view of the files activated. Strategies allows you to change synthesis parameters,
    Implementation gives you access to constraint files (which define pin mappings to modules), verilog / VHDL sources
    etc., and then there's *.sbx* files, generated by Clarity Designer, which we'll explore a little while later.
- Process:
    Defines the steps that will be taken from source to physical implementation. They are arranged hierarchically (e.g.
    running "Synthesize Design" will only run the first two tasks, while double-clicking on "Bitstream file" runs the
    whole task tree). You may also enable / disable components of the build process (for example, you might only want
    to create the Verilog simulation files, not the VHDL ones).
- Hierarchy:
    Outlines the module hierarchy in the context of our project. We'll also tackle this a bit later.
- Output:
    Displays the output of the current command, as well as errors, warnings or general information. From what I've seen,
    it's *unreliable* at best, sometimes showing errors, sometimes not, but, hey, we'll work with what we have.

For now, right-click on "Input files" in the "File list" section, then Add > New file > Verilog file to create our first
Verilog program. For this demo, I've picked up the code from the ULX3S GitHub repo (located 
[here](https://github.com/gojimmypi/ulx3s-examples/tree/master/blinky)) for a simple blinker program. You should be able
to download the file from [here](https://github.com/gojimmypi/ulx3s-examples/blob/master/blinky/blinky.v).

Right, now that we've our first Verilog file, time to start the process.
